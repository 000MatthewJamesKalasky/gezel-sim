This is README for GEZEL 2.2

Introduction
------------

GEZEL is a language and open environment for exploration, simulation,
and implementation of cycle-true hardware models. The models can be
simulated stand-alone, or cosimulated with one of the supported
instruction set simulators.

The GEZEL core is a C++ library that can be easily integrated into
other system simulation projects. This release includes the GEZEL
library along with several tools:
	- A Stand-alone simulator for GEZEL code
        - A Cosimulator for SystemC 2.0.1
        - A Cosimulator for JAVA models, with examples for the AVRORA ISS
        - A Cosimulator for MPSOC of i8051, ARM, Picoblaze
